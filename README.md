# AuroraGSI-RL
This plugin is a helper for [Aurora](http://www.project-aurora.com/), which is a unified RGB lighting program that allows you to sync RGB effects to in-game events supporting many peripheral brands and models.

Specifically, this plugin gets some data about the game and sends it in json format to Aurora, which then processes this and allows users to customize lighting.

Note: Currently the release version of Aurora doesn't support this plugin, you can follow its development in this [Pull Request](https://github.com/antonpup/Aurora/pull/1714)
